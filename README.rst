This package is designed to be able to switch string cases between snake_case, camelCase and PascalCase.
Other cases will be added in time, by request or necessity.

The hope is that our lexer will be able to parse practically any (reasonable) string, and can use the results to construct the string in a new case.

The name of the game here is flexibility. Creating a new case should be as simple as logically laying out a few rules.
